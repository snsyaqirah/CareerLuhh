# CareerLuhh

> **"Career First, Everything Else Later"**
> Talentbank First Cohort Tech Hackathon 2026 · Stage 1 Prototype

---

CareerLuhh is Asia's Career Co-Pilot — a multi-agent AI platform that guides users from student life through active employment. Unlike job portals that match by keyword, CareerLuhh matches by **trajectory**: where you're heading, not just where you've been.

Not IT-only. CareerLuhh covers every industry — Technology, Finance, Healthcare, HR, Logistics, Education, and more. Any career. One platform.

**Live demo:** 3 portals, 1 living Career Profile, 20 jobs across 8 industries, 16 specialised AI agents.

## The Problem We Solve

Malaysian graduates and job seekers face three systemic failures:

1. **No map.** Career counselling is scarce, expensive, or generic. Students graduate without knowing what roles match their trajectory — only what keywords to paste into a CV.
2. **No signal.** Job boards rank listings by recency or sponsored placement. Candidates can't see their fit, their gap, or what to do about it.
3. **No co-pilot.** Employers hire reactively. By the time a resignation lands, the signal was visible weeks earlier — if anyone was looking.

CareerLuhh solves all three: a living career profile that connects students, active candidates, and employers through AI agents that explain their reasoning in plain language.

## SDG Alignment

| SDG | Connection |
|---|---|
| **SDG 4 · Quality Education** | Career path guidance + skills gap analysis helps every Malaysian make better education and career decisions — not just those with access to good counsellors |
| **SDG 5 · Gender Equality** | Blind recruitment mode removes name, gender, photo, and university from screening — candidates evaluated on competency alone |
| **SDG 8 · Decent Work** | Salary benchmarking, gig-work credentialing, and a job board accessible without a top-5 university degree. TVET grads are first-class users |
| **SDG 10 · Reduced Inequalities** | Lokal Route compares net take-home in KL vs hometown. Rural youth aren't fooled by big city salary numbers |
